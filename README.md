# Online-Retail-Store-System
Designed the database schema, Implemented the database in MySQL, and creating an interface for user and seller.

Project Scope:
The online retail store system (generally known as e-commerce store) is used by consumers to look up and purchase products required. Internet enables such virtual stores, and customers shop on ease of a mouse click.
The stakeholders can be divided into sellers, store runners and buyers.
Suppliers-> They are sellers here. They get products and stock up warehouses, which is then updated onto our system. They, and the products they provide are managed by the admins.
Admins-> They are the online store runners working behind the scenes, They can manage and follow up on requests made by supplier. They are the ones updating and managing products from suppliers and the delivery processes.
Customer-> Customer can log in to our website. They look up through a list of products with their respective descriptions, price and more. They can add up multiple products in the cart and finally decide to place the order
The application is accessed by customers. Database pulls out information about products on the request of the customer. Product items in database are updated once every order is completed.

Concepts Applied:

Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling: 
Defined relationships between different entities in the system, such as customers, products, orders, and so on.

Data normalization: 
Organized the data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency, and to ensure the data is stored in a way that is easy to maintain and modify.

Indexing: 
Indexing was used to speed up the search and retrieval of data from a database by creating special data structures (indexes) to quickly locate specific records.

Transactions: 
This allowed our database to treat a series of related database operations as a single unit, so that either all the operations are completed, or none of them are completed, in the event of a failure or error.
